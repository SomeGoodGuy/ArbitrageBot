# OpenArbitrage

## What is this? 

A simple telegram bot that uses CCTX to identify arbitrage possibilities and do the trade. This implementation shall make the arbitrage operations more democratic and open.

## Why?

Because this is what Bitcoin is all about. Decentralized currency, decentralized strategies.

## Principles 

- ***All of this code has been made in only one night***. Please know that we are still in the process of making a final version.
- Not even the name is fixed. Any proposals of changing it should be inserted as an Issue. We promise that we are going to listen to you.
- This bot is free.

## Roadmap

- Implement more safety features (Env variables, shadow signatures)
- More options in the Telegram Menu to control the bot. 
- Make the API useful (possibly includes changes in CCTX lib as well - shall fork?).
- Make a guided simple UI
